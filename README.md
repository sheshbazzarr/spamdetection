 # 📧 Spam Detection

This is a simple machine learning project for detecting spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms.

## 🧠 Overview

The goal of this project is to classify text messages as either **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. It involves:

- Preprocessing text data
- Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF or CountVectorizer)
- Training and testing ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK (optional, for text cleaning)
- Jupyter Notebook
- streamlit

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sheshbazzarr/spamdetection.git
   cd spamdetection
